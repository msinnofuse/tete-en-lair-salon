  "about": {
    "intro": "For almost two decades, I have carried my passion for hairstyling in my heart. My roots run deep in the French hair artistry scene, where I not only completed my training as a hairstylist, but also honed my artistic skills as a makeup artist at the renowned Opera of Toulouse.",
    "experience": "My professional experience is extremely diverse and varied. In addition to my apprenticeship years at the opera, I have worked in various contexts: from classic to extravagant salons and special events as a stylist.",
    "expertise": "Whether wild, playful, or elegant - I welcome all hair types and specialize in short and long hairstyles, balayage techniques, practical low-maintenance ready-to-wear looks, highlights, gray tone coverage, and creative colorations.",
    "salon_description": "My salon «Tête-en-L'air» is anything but ordinary. Transformed from a former airport shuttle bus, it stands picturesquely on the Rhine in Basel's Holzpark Klybeck - a vibrant arts district full of inspiration. Surrounded by lovingly tended plants, it is a mobile wellness oasis that perfectly embodies my preference for the unexpected.",
    "languages": "I communicate fluently in French, German, English, and Spanish."
